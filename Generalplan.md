I would like to create the items described in the plan.md file.  I do not have foundry setup yet so I would like to build what I can then add in the Foundry integration later on.  We are going to use the NEW version of Foundry instead of classic.  There is another file that I am going to add into here that is more of the master plan vision that this protype for the "girls night out" is going to fit into.  So please hold off on any Foundry specific code until I get that other file added in.  For now just focus on building out the items described in plan.md as best as possible without Foundry integration.
